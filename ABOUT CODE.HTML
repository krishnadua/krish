Tech club provides activities and projects for students to explore the wide world of technology and modern industries. Students learn how to design and create projects using a laser engraver, a 3D printer, CNC router along with more traditional tools.

It provides range of services and networking opportunities through workshops, seminars, conventions and courses. CSI awards are instituted to acknowledge and motivate individuals and organizations working in the ICT field.

A Technology Club provides a place for the introduction of cohort study regarding principles and practices that are the foundation of understanding how technology and engineering support each other as well as how they work. At the heart of the Technology Club initiative lies true understanding of what we know; a mode of thought that goes well beyond the standard division of software and hardware, and that provides a framework within each student the ability to reason about systems and problems. This mode of thinking and understanding is supported and complemented by substantial theoretical and practical knowledge applications which enlighten the participant.
<br />

Technology Clubs goal is to provide practical subject matter promoting the ability for invention, resourcefulness and ultimately innovation. It prepares participants for the world that doesn’t yet exist, involving technologies that have not yet been invented, and that present technical and ethical challenges of which we are not yet aware.

The best tech teams I have worked with have all been made up of great communicators. In writing, verbal, stand up presentations, podcasts and other forms – they can get their point across fluidly. And it is the flow of ideas and feedback that is important here.
